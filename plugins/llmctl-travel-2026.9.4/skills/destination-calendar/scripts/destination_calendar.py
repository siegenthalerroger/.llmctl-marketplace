  python destination_calendar.py sources
  python destination_calendar.py selftest

`report` is the one to run: it merges both sources into one dated table and
annotates the dates that move prices -- bridge days and the long weekends they
create, and school-holiday spans, which drive family demand harder than public
holidays do and which most holiday APIs do not carry at all.

Two sources, both keyless, because neither covers the whole job:

  Nager.Date          200+ countries, public holidays only. The global floor.
                      Served from nagerholidays.com; the older date.nager.at
                      host is no longer the documented one.
  OpenHolidays API    European coverage, public *and* school holidays, with
                      subdivisions -- which matters because German Land and
                      Swiss canton calendars diverge by weeks.

Outside Europe `school` returns nothing and says so; that is a coverage gap to
state in the answer, not a finding of "no school holidays".

What this script deliberately does not do is find events. A Grand Prix, a Pride
weekend, a trade fair and a rail strike are what actually wreck a booking
window, and no keyless API ranks them. That half is the skill's search
protocol; this half is the half a machine can be trusted with.

When every Nager host refuses, `report` falls back to OpenHolidays for public
holidays too, and says so in the output: most windows asked about here are
European, and a partial answer beats none. Outside Europe that fallback knows
nothing, and its silence is reported as UNKNOWN rather than printed as an empty
table.

Exits 2 when no source answers, so a silent skip is impossible -- an empty table
because the network was down must never read as a clean window.

Python 3.9+. Runs on the standard library alone.
